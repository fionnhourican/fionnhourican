## Hi there 👋, Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hello! 👋 My name is Fionn Hourican. I'm currently in my final year of a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Dublin City University. Originally from County Longford, Ireland, I’m passionate about coding, especially in Full Stack Development. I enjoy building impactful projects, exploring new technologies, and continuously improving my skills. 💻✨

Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of Gaelic football 🏐 and enjoy staying active with fitness training 🏋️. I also love music 🎶, films 🎬, TV 📺, and reading 📖 —great ways to unwind and get inspired. I also love being around animals, like cats 🐱, dogs 🐶, horses 🐴, and goats 🐐.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - __Software Benchmarking Platform__ 🚀:
  Developing a system to measure and analyze software performance metrics, using Java Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and Docker for containerization.
  - __Data Mining Project__ 📊: 
    Using machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction for airline passengers, based on factors like wifi access, flight distance, and class type.
- 🌱 I’m currently independently learning about:
  - Advanced data visualization techniques to better represent insights
  - Security best practices for coding and dependency management
- 💬 Ask me about anything, if I can help I will! 😄
